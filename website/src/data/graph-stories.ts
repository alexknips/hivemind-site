/*
 * The site's graphs: the anatomy of a decision and four stories on the landing page
 * (everything there works in v0.7.0), and three stories on the use cases page (the bet,
 * the questions still waiting, the two lanes), which carry the parts that come next or
 * are planned. A story has one to three steps. Every node is placed by hand in a
 * 340-wide frame (the anatomy's wide variant is 1000 wide); graph.ts turns them into
 * SVG. Arrows run from the newer node to the older one, and the edge words are the
 * product's (docs/GRAPH_CONTRACT.md in hivemind).
 *
 * Status, as CLAIMS.md at the repo root records it: solid parts work in v0.7.0; parts
 * marked COMING NEXT are merged, not yet released; dashed parts marked PLANNED are
 * decided, not built. The examples are made up; the café, the newsletter and the jury
 * room are there on purpose, since HiveMind is not only for engineering.
