## Global flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--actor <id>` | Actor making this request. Format: `human:<id>` or `agent:<tool>:<name>` |
| `--hivemind-dir <path>` | Ledger directory (default: `./hivemind/`). Created on first write. |
| `--tenant <id>` | Tenant to read/write (default: `local`). Must already be a known tenant — see [Tenants](#tenants) below. |
| `--database-url <url>` | Shared Postgres backend connection URL. Unset or empty selects the local SQLite ledger under `--hivemind-dir` instead. A flag value beats `HIVEMIND_DATABASE_URL`. Requires the `shared-backend-postgres` feature. |
| `--json` | Emit structured JSON output |
| `--graph-backend <memory\|kuzu>` | Graph projection backend (default: `memory`) |

## Tenants

Every ledger open — CLI, HTTP API, and stdio MCP alike — validates `--tenant`
(or `X-HiveMind-Tenant` on the HTTP API) against a per-backend tenant
registry before any read or write. An unknown tenant is a hard error, not a
fresh empty scope: a typo'd `--tenant` must never look indistinguishable from
"this tenant just has no decisions yet."

**Default:** `--tenant local` (env `HIVEMIND_TENANT`). The `local` tenant is
seeded automatically for every SQLite ledger directory, so single-user/local
workflows need no tenant setup.

**SQLite — `hivemind tenant create`:** tenants are a per-`--hivemind-dir`
registry. Register a new one with:

```
hivemind tenant create <tenant-id>
```

Creates the tenant in the ledger directory named by
`--hivemind-dir`/`HIVEMIND_DIR` (errors if it already exists there). Add
`--json` for a structured `{tenant_id, hivemind_dir}` result. This subcommand
is SQLite-only — pointed at a Postgres backend (`--database-url` set) it
fails immediately, since Postgres tenants are provisioned server-side, not
by any CLI invocation.

**Postgres — server provisioning route:** tenants live in the shared
`hm_tenants` table and are created only through the server's admin-gated
`POST /v1/tenants` route (requires `HIVEMIND_ADMIN_KEY`). There is no CLI
equivalent by design — this is the same route the HTTP API's per-user and
WorkOS-OIDC auth paths depend on to have a tenant to resolve a caller into.

**The unknown-tenant error:** on both backends, opening a ledger for an
unregistered tenant fails with an error naming the tenant and the
backend-specific create path instead of silently opening a fresh, empty
scope:

```
unknown tenant 'acme-inc': run `hivemind tenant create acme-inc` to register it
```

```
unknown tenant 'acme-inc': tenants are created through the server's provisioning route (POST /v1/tenants), not the CLI
```

On the HTTP API this surfaces as `404 Not Found` for every read and write
endpoint alike (a wrong address, not a validation or server error). In
Postgres multi-tenant mode, clients never send a tenant header at all — the
bearer token (or, with WorkOS configured, the JWT's `org_id` claim) resolves
to the tenant server-side; `X-HiveMind-Tenant` only applies to SQLite
dev-mode auth, where it defaults to `local` when absent.

## Projects

A project is a named home for decisions inside a tenant. Every decision
belongs to exactly one project. Two kinds:

- **Shared project** — registered explicitly, by handle (`billing`:
  lowercase letters, digits, dashes; 2–40 characters; unique per tenant).
  Can carry **anchors** (a folder, a rig, a Jira/Linear/GitHub reference, a
  channel) and **links** to other projects: `part_of` (at most one active
  parent) and `depends_on` (no limit).
- **Personal project** — derived from the actor id (`personal:human:alice`,
  `personal:agent:claude`), never registered, always resolves. Comes with
  the identity, so it "cannot be a typo."

`project show` on an unknown handle returns a successful envelope with
`{"outcome": "not_found"}`, never an error — a miss is data, not an
exceptional condition.

### `project register`

```
hivemind --actor human:<id> project register <handle>
  [--display-name <name>]
  [--purpose <text>]
```

Registers a shared project. Refused if the handle is malformed, already
registered (names the existing project), or uses the reserved `personal:`
prefix.

### `project link` / `project unlink`

```
hivemind --actor human:<id> project link --from <handle> --to <handle> --kind <part_of|depends_on>
hivemind --actor human:<id> project unlink --from <handle> --to <handle> --kind <part_of|depends_on>
```

Links (or removes a link between) two registered projects. Both endpoints
must already be registered; `part_of` is refused if `from` already has a
different active parent; `unlink` is refused when no such link is
currently active.

### `project anchor`

```
hivemind --actor human:<id> project anchor --handle <handle> --kind <folder|rig|jira|linear|github|channel> --value <value>
```

Anchors a registered project to a place in the world. A `rig` anchor value
is unique per tenant.

### `project list`

```
hivemind project list [--limit <n>] [--cursor <cursor>]
```

Lists registered (shared) projects, paged (`truncated: true` with a
`next_cursor` when the limit is hit). Personal projects never appear here —
resolve one directly with `project show`.

### `project show`

```
hivemind project show <handle>
hivemind project show --current
```

Shows one project by handle, or a personal address
(`personal:<actor-id>`), which always resolves. `--current` shows the
actor's current-project setting (see `project use`) instead.

### `project use`

```
hivemind --actor human:<id> project use <handle>
hivemind --actor human:<id> project use --clear
```

Sets or clears the actor's **current project**: a one-time, per-machine
setting for captures with no repo or folder context (e.g. chat), consulted
below any folder marker or rig anchor. Local to `--hivemind-dir` and the
actor — it is never a ledger fact, so setting or clearing it appends no
event. Setting an unregistered handle is refused with a hint to register it
first.

## Emit commands

All `emit` commands append an event to the ledger. They require `--actor`.

### `emit decision.proposed`

```
hivemind emit decision.proposed
  --title <text>
  --rationale <text>
  [--topic-keys <key,key,...>]
  [--options <opt,opt,...>]
  [--chose <option>]
  [--decided-by <actor-id>]
  [--delegated-by <human:name>]
  [--still-proposed]
  [--quote <text>]
  [--question <text>]
  [--project <handle>]
  [--project-source <stated|folder_marker|rig|current_project|job>]
```

Prints the new decision ID on success, and only the ID on stdout, so
`id=$(hivemind emit ...)` keeps working. In text mode a second line on stderr
names the project the decision landed in: `project: <address> (<source>)`, plus
"saved to your personal project" when no `--project` was given. Add `--json`
for a structured envelope; it carries `project` and `project_source` (and
`project_notice` on the personal fallback) next to the ID.

There is no `--supersedes` flag on this command. To capture a decision that
reverses a prior one, use [`supersede`](#supersede) instead — it captures the
new decision and marks the old one superseded in a single call.

`--chose <option>` means the decision was already made: by default the command
self-accepts it immediately after proposing, via a `decision.accepted` event
from `--actor`. `--decided-by <actor-id>` names the actor who actually made the
decision when that differs from `--actor` (the recording actor/scribe) — for
example an agent writing down a decision a human made: `--actor
agent:claude:session --decided-by human:alex`; the accept event comes from
`--decided-by` instead. Requires `--chose`.

`--delegated-by <human:name>` marks an agent that decided for itself within a
scope a human delegated to it: the self-acceptance carries the delegating human,
so the record tells "the agent decided under a human's delegation" apart from
"the agent decided alone" (no flag). `--actor` must be an `agent:` actor, and a
`--decided-by` naming anyone else is refused — a human who decided is recorded
with `--decided-by`. Requires `--chose`. A standing delegation is the same value
repeated on each capture in that scope.

`--still-proposed` keeps the decision at `proposed` even though `--chose` is
set, for a genuine open recommendation awaiting someone else's decision.
Mutually exclusive with `--decided-by` and `--delegated-by`.

`--quote <text>` captures the verbatim words of the decider, self-contained —
not a bare reference like `"1a"` into a numbered list that only makes sense
next to the source conversation. It requires `--question <text>`: the
question those words answer, spelled out in the capturer's own words. Neither
flag works without the other — a quote with no stated question is unreadable
once the source conversation is gone.

`--project <handle>` files the decision under a registered project. An unknown
handle is refused with the [`project register`](#project-register) command to
run, and nothing is written. HiveMind checks the handle; it never works out
the project for you, so pass the one you know. Without `--project` the decision
is saved to the recorder's personal project (`personal:<actor>`, derived from
the actor, never registered) and the reply says so. `--project-source` records
how the handle was determined (default `stated`) and requires `--project`;
`personal_fallback` and `moved` are recorded by HiveMind itself and cannot be
claimed.

### `emit decision.capture`

Noninteractive shorthand for agent use. Defaults actor to a stable
`agent:<tool>:<name>`, records `source=agent`.

```
hivemind emit decision.capture
  --title <text>
  --rationale <text>
  [--topic-keys <key,...>]
  [--options <opt,...>]
  [--chose <option>]
  [--decided-by <actor-id>]
  [--delegated-by <human:name>]
  [--still-proposed]
  [--quote <text>]
  [--question <text>]
  [--project <handle>]
  [--project-source <stated|folder_marker|rig|current_project|job>]
```

Takes the same `--project` / `--project-source` flags and replies the same way
as [`emit decision.proposed`](#emit-decisionproposed).

### `emit decision.accepted`

```
hivemind emit decision.accepted --decision-id <decision-id>
```

### `emit decision.rejected`

```
hivemind emit decision.rejected --decision-id <decision-id>
```

### `emit decision.superseded`

```
hivemind emit decision.superseded --old <decision-id> --new <new-decision-id>
```

Marks one existing decision as superseding another existing decision. Both
must already exist — this only records the relationship. To capture the new
decision and mark the supersession in one call, use [`supersede`](#supersede)
instead.

### `emit evidence.recorded`

```
hivemind emit evidence.recorded --content <text> [--url <url>] [--for <decision-id>]
```

### `emit hypothesis.recorded`

```
hivemind emit hypothesis.recorded --statement <text> [--for <decision-id>]
```

### `emit ingest.batch_classified`

Keyless batch path: submit pre-classified captures from a plugin or edge session
directly — no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` needed. The server classifier skips this batch
because no companion `IngestBatchReceived` event exists for the batch ID.

```
hivemind emit ingest.batch_classified
  --captures <path>              # JSON file: array of CaptureItem objects
  [--classifier-model <name>]    # default: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
  [--schema-version <n>]         # must be "2"; default: 2
```

### `emit decision.scored`

Keyless scoring path: submit a pre-scored quality/importance assessment from a
plugin or edge session directly — no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` needed. The target
capture node is resolved from a prior `ingest.batch_classified` batch via
`--batch-id` + `--capture-index`, so callers never construct the
`capture:{event_id}:{idx}` node-id format themselves. Fails if the referenced
capture is not a `"decision"`. Scores are validated and clamped with the same
invariants as the server's own Haiku-backed scorer (`src/scorer.rs`).

```
hivemind emit decision.scored
  --batch-id <id>                 # batch_id from a prior emit ingest.batch_classified
  --capture-index <n>              # 0-based index of the decision capture in that batch
  --scores <path>                  # JSON file: {"quality_dims": {...}, "importance": {...}}
  [--scorer-model <name>]          # default: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
  [--weight-version <tag>]         # default: v1
```

## Query commands

All `query` commands return JSON. They never write to the ledger.

### `query get_decision`

```
hivemind query get_decision --id <decision-id>
```

Returns the full decision node with current derived status, supersession chain tip,
and `hypothesis_refuted` flag if any assumed hypothesis has been refuted.

### `query search_decisions`

```
hivemind query search_decisions
  [--topic <key>]
  [--status <proposed|accepted|contested|superseded>]
  [--actor <pattern>]
  [--since <duration>]     # e.g., 7d, 30d, 1h
  [--limit <n>]            # default 20
  [--offset <n>]
```

Returns `{ decisions: [...], truncated: bool, total: n }`.

To list all `contested` decisions (note: `disagree` is a top-level write command,
not a query subcommand):

```
hivemind query search_decisions --status contested
```

### `query recall`

Layer-3 search + summarise in one call. Answers "what was decided about X?".

```
hivemind query recall [<free-text query>]
  [--topic <key,...>]
  [--status <status,...>]
  [--since <duration>]
  [--limit <n>]          # default 5
```

### `query recent`

```
hivemind query recent
  [--limit <n>]
  [--actor <pattern>]
  [--since <duration>]
  [--unreviewed-only]
```

### `query get_supersession_chain`

Alias: `chain`.

```
hivemind query get_supersession_chain (<free-text description> | --id <decision-id>)
  [--pick <n>]             # disambiguate when a description matches more than one decision
  [--topic <key>]          # narrow description resolution to this topic
```

Returns the full chain from the resolved decision back to the original proposal. A free-text
`<description>` resolves to a decision the same way `search`/`recall` do (deterministic term +
topic + recency ranking; see `docs/AGENT_FLUENT_QUERYING.md` in the repo for the full design); if
it matches more than one decision with no clear best match, the response is `{"outcome":
"ambiguous", "candidates": [...]}` instead — re-run with `--pick <n>`, a bare `#<n>` referring to
that candidate list, or `--id`. `--id` bypasses resolution entirely and is unchanged from before.

### `query compact-view`

Layer-3 signal/noise filter over a decision's subgraph.

```
hivemind query compact-view (<free-text description> | --id <decision-id>)
  [--pick <n>]
  [--topic <key>]
```

Same fluent resolution as `get_supersession_chain` above.

### `query get_decision_neighborhood`

Alias: `why`.

```
hivemind query get_decision_neighborhood (<free-text description> | --id <decision-id>)
  [--pick <n>]
  [--topic <key>]
  [--depth <n>]            # default 1
  [--relations <kind,...>]
  [--compact]              # return a compact-view instead of the raw neighborhood
```

Same fluent resolution as `get_supersession_chain` above.

### `query get_decision_outcome`

Alias: `verify`. "Did this decision hold up?" — leads with the decision, rationale, rejected
options, who decided, and whether it still holds (superseded / stale premises / contested /
thin structure), composing `get_decision` + `get_decision_context` + `get_decision_outcome`
into one `DecisionBrief` answer. Distinct from the bulk `review` command below, which reports
across many decisions rather than answering this about one.

```
hivemind query get_decision_outcome (<free-text description> | --id <decision-id>)
  [--pick <n>]
  [--topic <key>]
```

Same fluent resolution as `get_supersession_chain` above. IDs (`decision_id`, chosen/rejected
`option_id`) appear only as trailing handles for follow-up — never required reading to
understand the answer.

### `query get_relevant_decisions`

```
hivemind query get_relevant_decisions --topic <key> [--status <status>]
```

### `query situational`

"What should I know before I touch this?" — decisions bearing on the working
situation, no id or hand-typed question needed. Matches by exact `topic_keys`
membership and by deterministic term overlap against evidence content; each
result surfaces `get_decision_outcome`'s `held_up`/`reasons` verbatim.

```
hivemind query situational
  [--paths <file,dir,...>]     # defaults to the current git diff + staged set
  [--diff]                     # read a unified diff from stdin instead
  [--branch]                   # include the current branch name's tokens
  [--cwd]                      # include the current working directory's path segments
  [--since-offset <ledger-offset>]
  [--since-ts <timestamp>]
  [--since-branch-point]       # resolve --since to this branch's merge-base commit time
  [--base <ref>]               # base ref for --since-branch-point, default origin/master
  [--limit <n>]
```

With no flags at all, defaults to the current git diff/staged set in the
working directory — the "no question needed" mode. Requires a git repository
when relying on that default, `--branch`, or `--cwd`; pass `--paths`/`--diff`
explicitly otherwise.

### `query get_active_decision_blockers`

```
hivemind query get_active_decision_blockers
  [--decision-id <id,...>]
  [--topic <key,...>]
  [--owner <actor-id,...>]
  [--blocked-actor <actor-id,...>]
  [--priority <level,...>]
  [--limit <n>]
```

### `query get_recent_activity`

```
hivemind query get_recent_activity
  [--actor-id <id,...>]
  [--topic <key,...>]
  [--status <status,...>]
  [--limit <n>]
```

### `query get_decisions_changed_since`

```
hivemind query get_decisions_changed_since
  [--since-offset <ledger-offset>]
  [--since-ts <timestamp>]
  [--until-offset <ledger-offset>]
  [--until-ts <timestamp>]
  [--limit <n>]
```

### `query get_decisions_added_since`

```
hivemind query get_decisions_added_since
  [--since <duration>]
  [--since-offset <ledger-offset>]
  [--since-ts <timestamp>]
  [--limit <n>]
```

### `query export_read_only_summary`

```
hivemind query export_read_only_summary
```

### `query score_decision`

In-house explainable quality score for a single decision.

```
hivemind query score_decision --id <decision-id>
```

Returns a score, quality tier, list of reasons, and contributing node IDs.
No LLM involved; pure graph-signal heuristics.

### `query scan_decision_quality`

Bulk in-house quality scan: scores all decisions (or a filtered subset) using
the same explainable graph-signal engine as `score_decision`. Designed for
scheduled quality-scan loops. Precision-biased: use `--min-tier` to surface
only significant or high-concern decisions.

```
hivemind query scan_decision_quality
  [--since-event-origin <offset>]   # filter to decisions proposed at or after this ledger offset
  [--limit <n>]                     # 1–1000, default 25
  [--cursor <token>]                # pagination cursor from a previous response
  [--min-tier <tier>]               # clean|minor_concerns|significant_concerns|high_concern
```

### `query scan_misfiled_decisions`

Flags decisions carrying a caller-named "foreign" topic key — a decision
tagged with another ledger's name most likely belongs there instead.
Deterministic exact-match only, no LLM: HiveMind does not yet know which
project a ledger belongs to, so the caller supplies the foreign keys.
Read-only report — never moves a decision.

```
hivemind query scan_misfiled_decisions
  --foreign-topic <key>[,<key>...]  # required; repeatable or comma-separated
  [--limit <n>]                     # 1–1000, default 25
  [--cursor <token>]                # pagination cursor from a previous response
```

## Other commands

### `tenant create`

```
hivemind tenant create <tenant-id>
```

Registers a tenant in the local SQLite ledger's tenant registry so it passes
the known-tenant check on later `--tenant <tenant-id>` opens. See
[Tenants](#tenants) above for the full contract, including the Postgres
provisioning route this command does not apply to.

### `project register` / `link` / `unlink` / `anchor` / `list` / `show` / `use`

```
hivemind project register <handle> [--display-name <name>] [--purpose <text>]
hivemind project link --from <handle> --to <handle> --kind <part_of|depends_on>
hivemind project unlink --from <handle> --to <handle> --kind <part_of|depends_on>
hivemind project anchor --handle <handle> --kind <folder|rig|jira|linear|github|channel> --value <value>
hivemind project list [--limit <n>] [--cursor <cursor>]
hivemind project show <handle>
hivemind project show --current
hivemind project use <handle>
hivemind project use --clear
```

Manage the project registry. See [Projects](#projects) above for the full
contract, including the `personal:<actor-id>` address, the `not_found`
envelope on `show`, and the actor-local `use`/`show --current`
current-project setting.

### `quickstart`

```
hivemind --actor human:<id> quickstart
```

Creates an isolated temporary ledger, records a sample decision, queries it back,
and prints the result. No files are left behind.

### `review`

```
hivemind --actor human:<id> review
  [--actor <pattern>]      # filter by actor (e.g., 'agent:*')
  [--since <duration>]
  [--unreviewed-only]
```

Interactive terminal review flow. See [Human Review](../../guides/human-review/).

### `mcp`

```
hivemind mcp [--session-id <id>]
```

Start the MCP stdio server. See [MCP Setup](../../guides/mcp-setup/).

### `dump`

```
hivemind dump --format <dot|json>
```

Export the current projected graph as DOT (Graphviz) or JSON.

### `export`

```
hivemind export --format markdown --out <dir>
  [--project <handle>]
  [--since <RFC3339>]
  [--topic <key,key,...>]
  [--status <status,status,...>]
```

Renders the decision log as a tree of Markdown files under `--out`, grouped per
project. Every decision belongs to exactly one project, so it is written exactly
once:

- `INDEX.md` — one section per project (a link to the project's own record and
  the table of its decisions, newest-first), so reading it top to bottom is the
  whole record.
- `projects/<handle>/INDEX.md` — one project's record on its own, and
  `projects/<handle>/decisions/*.md` — one file per matching decision.
- `projects/personal/<actor>/` — the same, for a personal project (derived from
  the recorder, never registered). The actor part is reduced to path-safe
  characters; two personal addresses that reduce to the same name each get a
  short hash of their full address appended, so they never share a directory.

Every registered project has a record, including one with no decisions yet
(`Counts: none.`); a personal project appears once it holds a decision. A
supersession between projects links across them.

`--project <handle>` writes only that project's files (a registered handle, or
a `personal:<actor>` address). An unknown handle writes nothing and reports
`outcome=not_found` — a successful envelope, never an empty tree that reads like
"that project has no decisions". `--format` accepts only `markdown` today.
`--since`, `--topic`, and `--status` narrow which decisions are included and are
ANDed together with `--project`.

`--out` is created if missing. The export **owns** `<out>/INDEX.md` and every
`.md` file under `<out>/projects/` (plus any left in `<out>/decisions/` by the
flat layout used before decisions were grouped per project): any such file this
run did not produce is removed, and directories that empties go with it, so a
narrower filter or a compacted ledger never leaves stale files behind. A
`--project` run therefore leaves only that project under `projects/`, so give
each project's record its own `--out`. Nothing else under `--out` is touched. `--out`
pointing at an existing file fails before any write.

Every byte is derived from the graph (ledger timestamps, immutable ids and
titles, derived status) — re-running with an unchanged ledger and the same
filters produces a byte-identical tree. Not an MCP tool: the intended
consumer is a scheduled CLI run that commits the tree to a repo, which has
no use for a directory tree returned as one JSON payload.

Prints a one-line summary (`out_dir=... ledger_offset=... files_written=...
files_removed=...`) or, with `--json`, the same fields as a JSON object tagged
`"outcome": "exported"`. An unknown `--project` prints
`outcome=not_found project=<handle>` (JSON: `{"outcome":"not_found","project":"<handle>"}`).

### `import documents`

```
hivemind --actor <id> import documents [--file <path> | <directory>]
  [--on-conflict <keep_existing|supersede|contest|add_context>]
  [--extractor-command <command>]
  [--extractor-arg <arg>]
  [--llm-response <path>]
  [--json]
```

Import decisions from markdown or text files. All imported decisions land in
the ledger immediately as **unreviewed** (proposed, not auto-accepted) and flow
into the review step (`hivemind review --unreviewed-only`).

Auto-detection: if a file contains explicit `Decision:` blocks, the
deterministic block parser runs. If it does not, the file is treated as prose
and the extractor configured via `--extractor-command` (or a pre-computed
`--llm-response`) is used to extract candidate decisions. Prose extraction
requires one of those two flags; without them a prose file produces no output.

Re-importing identical input is a no-op. Changed same-id re-imports report
conflicts by default; resolve with `--on-conflict`.

### `tui`

```
hivemind tui [--q <query>] [--topic <key>] [--status <status>] [--dot-output <path>]
```

Read-only terminal UI for decision search and graph navigation.
Requires build with `--features tui`.

### `supersede`

```
hivemind --actor <id> supersede [<description>]
  [--old <decision-id>]
  [--pick <n>]
  [--topic <topic-key>]
  --title <text>
  --rationale <text>
  [--topic-keys <key,key,...>]
  [--options <opt,opt,...>]
  [--chose <option>]
  [--hypotheses <id,id,...>]
  [--evidence <id,id,...>]
  [--project <handle>]
  [--project-source <stated|folder_marker|rig|current_project|job>]
```

Captures a new decision and marks it as superseding an existing one in a
single call — the write path for "this reverses an earlier decision."
Resolve the decision being superseded either with `--old <decision-id>` or a
free-text `<description>` fragment (narrow candidates first with `--topic`);
an ambiguous description short-circuits without writing and returns numbered
candidates to disambiguate with `--pick <n>`. Retrying with the same resolved
old decision and the same new-decision fields is idempotent — it returns the
same `new_decision_id` and appends no new ledger events.

Prints `old_decision_id`, `new_decision_id`, `old_decision_status` (now
`superseded`), `new_decision_status`, and the `project` and `project_source`
the new decision was filed under. Add `--json` for the structured form, which
also carries `project_notice` on the personal fallback.

Without `--project` the new decision inherits the old decision's project and how
it was determined; `--project <handle>` (a registered project, with an optional
`--project-source`) files it elsewhere, exactly as on
[`emit decision.proposed`](#emit-decisionproposed). In text mode the same
`project: ...` line goes to stderr.
